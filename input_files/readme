# MESH FILES

1C3_5.1.ele and 1C3_5.1.node files contain a description of the input mesh geometry of cell 1C3_5.
These were used as input to the source code (1C3_5.py) and were generated using the trinagle mesh generator.

# CELLML FILES

mitochondria_new.cellml contains the ODEs describing mitochondrial OXPHOS reactions.
myofibril_new.cellml contains the ODEs describing myofibrillar reactions.

# INITIAL CONDITIONS

inputs.txt containts the diffusivity values and intial micromolar concentrations of the metabolites simulated in the model.
