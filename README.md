# Cardiac energetics

A set of codes to simulate mitochondrial OXPHOS and energy metabolism in cardiac cells using FE methods.

The code uses the OpenCMISS libraries (www.opencmiss.org) to set up the simulation framework.

The meshes used in these simulations were generated from 2D (TEM) cross sectional images of cardiomyocytes.
